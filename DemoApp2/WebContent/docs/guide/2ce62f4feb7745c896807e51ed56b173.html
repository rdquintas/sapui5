<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">KPIs modelled using the Wave 2, 3, 4, and 5 version of the KPI modeler should be
		migrated from the old SAP Smart Business KPI modeler to the new SAP Smart Business modeler
		apps version.</p>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Delta List</div><div type="Delta List">
			
			<div class="p">The following list describes the differences between the old and the new frameworks
				that are relevant for migration: <ol class="ol" id="loio2ce62f4feb7745c896807e51ed56b173__ol_gmq_mpp_np"><li class="li">Variant<p class="p">The evaluation and the variant are merged into a single object
							(the evaluation). The migration tool makes this change
							automatically.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">Percent<div class="p">If you have a percentage based KPI, you must do the following:<ul class="ul" id="loio2ce62f4feb7745c896807e51ed56b173__ul_y3h_wpp_np"><li class="li">Use the scaling factor <span class="ph uicontrol">Percent</span> in the evaluation </li>
<li class="li">Add an extra measure in your <span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span> Live views that provides
									the percent value as a fraction of 1 and not as a fraction of
									100 (for example, this can be a calculated measure).</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li class="li">Trend<p class="p">The trend has been simplified. Previously, to establish a trend you had to define
							two evaluations (one for the current value and another for an earlier
							time period).</p>
<p class="p">You can now use one evaluation (and one request to
							the backend) to retrieve the current value in one measure and the value
							that the trend is derived from in a separate measure (for example, a
							measure that provides the current value as of two weeks ago). This means
							that you must later extend your <span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span> Live views by this measure. We
							recommend that you add an input parameter that provides the timeframe in
							your query.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">Unit of Measure<p class="p">You can no longer specify or overwrite the unit of measure (UoM) in the
							KPI Modeler. Instead, the <span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span> Live view should expose the
						UoM.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">Decimals<p class="p">You can no longer specify the decimal in the modeler. Instead,
							this is provided in the OData service. For decimals that are not
							currency-based but UoM-based, you can provide the number of decimals
							directly in the <span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span> Live view. For currency-based apps, the backend
							automatically generates results with the default number of decimals for
							that currency (if it is configured correctly).</p>
</li>
<li class="li">App to App Navigation<p class="p">The URL schema has changed. Custom apps now must deal with a chip
							(tile) ID and the evaluation ID instead of the KPI ID and the variant ID
							as was previously the case.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">Navigating from Drill-Down Application for KPI 1 to Drill-Down Application
						for KPI 2<p class="p">This feature has been replaced by the feature that lets you add
							associated KPIs to the drill-down application and click them to navigate
							to them.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Prerequisites</div><div type="Prerequisites">
			
			<p class="p">You have installed both the old version and the new version of the modeler in the
				same system before starting the migration process. The Migration Tool
				assumes that both the old tables and the new tables are available in the same
				backend system. </p>

			<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> You should migrate all content at once and not use the old and the new framework at the
				same time other than during the migration itself. If you have built custom apps that
				integrate with the SAP Smart Business framework we recommend adjusting the custom
				apps such that they support the new framework and then switch over productive use
				only to the new version of your custom app.</div>

			<ol class="ol" id="loio2ce62f4feb7745c896807e51ed56b173__ol_oxb_lqp_np"><li class="li">Launch the Migration Tool app and select the KPIs that you want
					to migrate. A message lets you know if some or all of the KPIs are already
					migrated. If you choose to migrate again, forced migration occurs.<p class="p">If the KPIs
						contain evaluations and drill-downs, the details are displayed.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">Adjust the IDs generated for the new evaluations. The Migration Tool app
					proposes a new ID for each evaluation. You must adjust this proposal to suit
					your requirements. We recommend the following naming convention:
						<span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">KPI_ID.shortEvaluationID</span> (for
					example,
						<span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">sap.hba.ecc.ProjectCompletion.ProjectPercentageofCompletion</span>).</li>
<li class="li">Adjust the IDs generated for the new drill-downs. Under <span class="ph uicontrol">IDs after
						Migration</span>, click <span class="ph uicontrol">Configured Drill-Down</span>
					and edit the ID in the dialog box. Click <span class="ph uicontrol">Save and
					Close</span>.</li>
<li class="li">Choose <span class="ph uicontrol">Migrate</span> to start the migration process. </li>
<li class="li">Create new tiles using the Configure KPI Tiles app. The tile visualizations
					associated with the KPI are not migrated. As a result, you must create and
					activate new tile visualizations using the Configure KPI Tiles
					app after you migrate a KPI.</li>
</ol>

			<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> You can repeat the migration, however this overrides the already migrated
				content.</div>

			<p class="p">To migrate your custom app so that it works with the new SAP Smart Business KPI tile
				and drill-down, your custom app must react to different parameters in the URL
				provided by the KPI tile. Previously, the KPI ID and the variant ID were required;
				now, a newly generated chip ID that refers to the metadata in the KPI tile is
				required along with the evaluation ID (and optionally the view ID). When navigating
				to another app, you must provide the chip ID that refers to the KPI tile and the
				evaluation ID. When being called, you can use the services offered by the SAP Smart
				Business repository to retrieve metadata for the evaluation based on its ID.</p>

					the migrated KPIs and their associated entities. Bring up the KPI, evaluation,
					and drill-down and check that all field values are correct.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> The new SAP
						Smart Business application deals with percentage values differently, for
						this reason you must add a measure to your calculation view that divides
						your original value by 100.</div>
</li>
<li class="li">If you have custom navigation options, re-establish them for the new tile and
					drill-down and check that they function as before.</li>

					benefit your use case and adjust them accordingly.</li>
<li class="li">If you have migrated all of the KPIs, users cannot access the old KPIs and you
