<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Describes inner-app navigation in SAPUI5</p>
<div class="p">Navigation is used for the following use cases:<ul class="ul" id="loio3d18f20bd2294228acb6910d8e8a5fb5__ul_scj_gk2_1p"><li class="li">
                    <p class="p">Browser History Handling</p>

                    <p class="p">On mobile devices you do not only have the browser back but also physical
                        back buttons (android).</p>

                </li>
<li class="li">
                    <p class="p">Bookmarks/Deep Links</p>

                    <p class="p">bookmark/deep link a page inside an app. This means we can start the app and
                        resume the bookmarked state.</p>

                </li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="p">For routing, SAPUI5 uses a hash-based navigation that enables you to pass data from the
            hash to any view, and to adjust a current hash so that you can use it as a bookmarkable
            URL. Depending on the hash, you can also generate views automatically. And it enables
            the app users to use the browser history buttons for navigation. The one-page apps of
            SAPUI5 enable navigation by changing the hash: The browser does not reload the page,
            instead there is a callback to which the app and especially the affected view can react.
            Therefore, a string (the hash) is used, which is parsed and matched against patterns
            which will then inform the handlers. SAPUI5 uses Crossroads.js for parsing the hash and
            the Hasher framework for manipulating the hash.</p>
<p class="p">The following general rules apply:</p>
<ul class="ul" id="loio3d18f20bd2294228acb6910d8e8a5fb5__ul_zd5_hl2_1p"><li class="li">
                <p class="p">The user can always navigate back to the previous page.</p>

            </li>
<li class="li">
                <p class="p">Each full page change creates an entry in the back chain (browser history).</p>

            </li>
<li class="li">
                <p class="p">The <span class="ph uicontrol">Back</span> button in the upper left corner of an app has
                    always the same functionality as browser back.</p>

            </li>
<li class="li">
                <p class="p">All pages can be bookmarked.</p>

            </li>
<li class="li">
                <p class="p">Dialogs and popovers can <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">not</span> be bookmarked.</p>

            </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Navigation with Master-detail pattern, for example, is different for desktop/tablet and
            mobile device. This is not done by the framework and has to be taken care of in the
            application.</p>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Pattern Matching</div><div type="Pattern Matching">
            
            <p class="p">A route is used to notify your application that the hash has changed to a certain
                value. When a route matches the hash, it provides the data passed over the hash to a
                defined handler. The pattern of the route is matched against the hash. If the
                pattern matches your application will also get the parameters.</p>

            <div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint">// Some basic patterns
{
    "pattern" : "product" // ”product” is mandatory, e. g. the following hash only would match: product

    "pattern" : "product/{id}" // {id} is a mandatory parameter, e. g. the following hashes would match: product/5, product/3

    "pattern" : "product/{id}/detail/:detailId:" // :detailId: is an optional parameter, e. g. the following hashes would match: product/5/detail, product/3/detail/2

    "pattern" : "product{?query}" // {?query} allows you to pass queries with any parameters, e. g. the following hashes would match: product?first=firstValue, product?first=firstValue&amp;second=secondValue

    "pattern" : ":all*:" // this pattern can be used to define a catchall route, e. g. the following hashes would match: foo, product/5/3, product/5/detail/3/foo
}
</pre></div>

            <p class="p">When defining routes, the order is important: Only the first route that matches is
                matched. The following rule applies: Define specific routes first. Define catchall
                routes as the last route. The first route that is hit is informed. All routes
                defined after the first route that was hit are ignored.</p>
