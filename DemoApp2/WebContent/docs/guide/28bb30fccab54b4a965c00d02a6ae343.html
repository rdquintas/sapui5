<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Key Features</div><div type="Key Features">
			
			<p class="p">The following SAP Smart Business modeler apps are available:</p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loio28bb30fccab54b4a965c00d02a6ae343__ul_lct_2jj_n4"><li class="li">Create KPI<p class="p">You use this app to create key performance indicators (KPIs) or operational
						performance indicators (OPIs). KPIs identify and measure the key metrics of
						a business. OPIs are similar to KPIs in that both measure the metrics of an
						aspect of a business. But while a KPI looks at broad categories (for
						example, car sales in a particular country or region), an OPI measures a
						specific process or operation - typically one at a bottleneck for a
						business. For example, an OPI for a shipping company would look at orders
						shipped on time. You can save KPIs or OPIs in an intermediate state if the
						complete information is not yet available (for more information, see <a class="xref" href="2ee2365cbbdc405bad32401fee1a9fbb.html">Create KPI</a> under <span class="ph uicontrol">Related
							Links</span> in this document). For more information about statues,
						see section <span class="ph uicontrol">SAP Smart Business Entity Statuses</span> in
						this document.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">Create Evaluation<p class="p">You create an evaluation to define a specific representation
						of a KPI or OPI, which means that you define a certain selection of the KPI
						data, the targets and thresholds that are relevant, together with some
						additional information. For example, you have defined a KPI to monitor car
						sales in a particular country. You can then create an evaluation that
						restricts the results to a certain area of that country for which one sales
						representative is responsible.</p>
<p class="p">You must specify an active KPI or OPI
						when you are creating an evaluation. The KPI data is copied to the
						evaluation as a proposal but you can overwrite it later.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">Manage KPI Authorizations<p class="p">You use this app to authorize users or user roles
						for evaluations. An SAP Smart Business user can only see an evaluation, its
						tiles, and its drill-down views at runtime when you assign the user or role
						to the evaluation using this app and when you have activated all
						entities.</p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> An entity that you create using the SAP Smart Business
						modeler apps is not automatically visible to you when you logon to the
						runtime environment unless you have been authorized for the related
						evaluation.</div>
</li>
<li class="li">Configure KPI Tiles<p class="p">With this app, you configure tiles for active evaluations as the
						starting point for further analysis of a KPI or and OPI. At runtime, you
						click the KPI or OPI tile to open either an SAP Smart Business generic
						drill-down application or another type of specified analysis screen (for
						example, SAP Lumira). You can choose how to visualize the
						tile by selecting one of  the available tile types (numeric, comparison,
						trend, or actual vs. target).</p>
</li>
</ul>

			<ul class="ul" id="loio28bb30fccab54b4a965c00d02a6ae343__ul_dx5_mlj_n4"><li class="li">Configure KPI Drill-Down<p class="p">You use this app to configure different views, charts, filters,
						and associated KPIs for an active evaluation. You configure the drill-down
						so that you can analyze the KPI or OPI in further detail at runtime.
					</p>
</li>
<li class="li">Manage KPI Associations<p class="p">This app allows you to define a relationship between
						active KPIs. You can choose to define either a supporting or a conflicting
						association depending on the relationship between the two KPIs. Supporting
						associations apply when the two KPIs influence each other in a positive way,
						for example, the net advertisement cost and the cost of manufacturing for
						goods contribute to the cost of goods sold KPI. Conflicting associations
						apply when two KPIs influence each other in a negative way, for example, the
						net sales and net cost KPIs are associated in a conflicting way to provide a
						value for the net revenue KPI.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">KPI Workspace<p class="p">The KPI Workspace app allows you to access all of your KPIs or
						OPIs in one place. You can activate, edit, delete, or duplicate a KPI or OPI
						as well as add them to your favorites.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">Migration Tool<p class="p">Former versions of SAP Smart Business used a different
						architecture. You can use the migration tool app to migrate old KPIs and
						related entities to the latest version of SAP Smart Business, which offers
						improved usability and a newly designed user interface.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Interaction Between SAP Smart Business Modeler Apps</div><div type="Interaction Between SAP Smart Business Modeler Apps">
			
			<p class="p">KPIs and OPIs are the central entities of SAP Smart Business. You can create KPIs and OPIs
				using the Create KPI app. Based on this KPI or OPI, you can then
				create an evaluation using the Create Evaluation app. </p>

			<p class="p">When you have created an evaluation, you must choose a tile to visualize the KPI or OPI using
				the Configure KPI Tiles app. This lets you define how the tile appears in the
				runtime environment (for example, the SAP Fiori Launchpad). You must then define
				what happens when the SAP Smart Business user clicks the KPI or OPI tile at runtime.
				You define this using the Configure KPI Drill-Down app.</p>

			<p class="p">If required, you can define associations between KPIs using the Manage KPI
					Associations app. You can add associated KPIs to a KPIâ€™s drill-down
				where they are displayed in the header area in the form of KPI mini charts. Finally,
				you must define which user or user role can access the evaluation and related
				entities at runtime. You do this using the Manage KPI Authorizations
				app.</p>

			<p class="p">You can manage all KPIs, OPIs, and evaluations that are available in the system through the
					KPI Workspace app. If you have used previous versions of SAP
				Smart Business, you can migrate your existing KPIs and related entities to the new
				SAP Smart Business version using the Migration Tool app.</p>

<div class="section"><div class="section_title">SAP Smart Business Modeler App Users</div><div type="SAP Smart Business Modeler App Users">
			
			<p class="p">The SAP Fiori Launchpad enables you to find and retain the modeler apps required to
				carry out your work (for example, by using role-based allocation of default apps and
				app groups and personalization to add or remove additional apps from a global
				catalog).</p>

			<p class="p">To create new KPIs, you must understand related KPIs from the same and from different
				business areas. You must also be aware of the implications from a business
				perspective of introducing the new KPI. Therefore, the Create KPI and
				the Manage KPI Associations apps are used principally by data
				analysts or operations office employees. In addition, technical knowledge and
				alignment with development teams that build <span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span> views is required to link a KPI
				to a data source and provide the required input parameters. </p>

			<p class="p">IT administrative knowledge is required to authorize users and roles for evaluations
				and to define navigation targets for KPI tiles. Therefore, the Manage KPI
					Authorizations, Create Evaluation, and Configure
					KPI Tiles apps are used principally by IT personnel.</p>

			<p class="p">Business knowledge is required to configure the drill-down views correctly and as a
				result the Configure KPI Drill-Down app is used mainly by data
				analysts and power users that are close to business users who benefit from and use
				the drill-down views at runtime. </p>

			<p class="p">All user groups benefit from the versatility that the KPI Workspace
				app provides to search and browse through the KPI repository.</p>

			<div class="p">Use Cases<ol class="ol" id="loio28bb30fccab54b4a965c00d02a6ae343__ol_mn2_w2j_lp"><li class="li">Validation of Technical Installation and Configuration<p class="p">To check whether the SAP Smart
							Business framework and all required components are installed and
							configured correctly, you can use the content provided with the <span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span>
							Live Program. For example, you can use the SAP Smart Business for Sales
							Order Fulfillment content and combine it with your data from the Sales
							and Deliveries (SD) module.</p>
<p class="p">To enable this use case, the content
							provides <span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span>
							Live views, OData service definitions, KPIs, evaluations, tiles, and
							drill-down configurations. All of them appear in the Active status in
							the system in which you install the content.</p>
<p class="p">If a user has the two
							required roles allocated to them on both the <span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span>
							server and the ABAP server (and has the correct analytical privileges)
							the only additional steps that you must take to allow this user to add
							the tile to their home page and create a drill-down are as
							follows:</p>
<ol class="ol" type="a" id="loio28bb30fccab54b4a965c00d02a6ae343__ol_tx4_1fj_lp"><li class="li">Make data available in the tables that are the basis for the <span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span> Live views.</li>
<li class="li">Change the filters and input parameters of the delivered evaluations
								to match the data that you have in the system and other parameters
								(such as the client and display currency).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="li">Proof of Concept and Rapid Prototyping<p class="p">After you complete the steps
							described in use case 1 (Validation of Technical Installation and
							Configuration) using meaningful production data, you can work with
							business users to demonstrate the possibilities offered by the KPIs and
							drill-downs. In addition, you can prototype KPIs, tiles, and drill-downs
							to match their requirements. This lets you engage the business users in
							quick, iterative cycles to demonstrate what they must do to carry out
							customizing and set it to go-live.</p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> When you re-import SAP
							content or upgrade it to the newest version, your adjustments to
							evaluations and any other changes to SAP content are lost or the system
							may override them.</div>
</li>
<li class="li">Productive Use<p class="p">Ahead of productive use, we recommend that you either copy the KPIs,
							evaluations, tiles, and drill-down configurations or re-create them in
							your own namespace to prevent unexpected outcomes if you install a new
							version of SAP delivered content.</p>
