<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">There are a few limitations in the compatibility of custom applications that have to be
		considered when extending SAPUI5 standard applications.</p>
<p class="p">Offering modification-free extensions and customizing allows to ship new versions of the
			application without overwriting customer-specific modifications. Thus, these
			modifications can survive an application upgrade. However, the degree of compatibility
			which can be guaranteed is limited. If a view is replaced by a custom view but the
			original view is no longer used, the custom view will, of course, also no longer be
			used. Or, if a custom controller extension accesses a field in the original view, it has
			to be able to cope with the possibility that the field may no longer exist or have a
			different type in an upgraded version of the application, otherwise it will break.</p>
<p class="p">;amy possible reasons exit that modifications can not be applied any longer or even break the
			upgraded version of an application and it is, therefore, not possible to compile an
			exhaustive list of all possible reasons. The following list gives some examples:</p>
<ul class="ul" id="loioaef3384510724522a07df94ec90d1351__ul_xj3_syl_pp"><li class="li">
				<p class="p">View modifications (hiding controls)</p>

				<ul class="ul" id="loioaef3384510724522a07df94ec90d1351__ul_elz_syl_pp"><li class="li">
						<p class="p">If the original control is no longer used or has a different or not a
							given ID, a view modification will no longer be applied.</p>

					</li>
<li class="li">
						<p class="p">If the original view name is changed or the view is no longer used, a
							view modification will no longer be applied.</p>

					</li>
<li class="li">
						<p class="p">However, a view modification is simply ignored and will never lead to a
							crash.</p>

					</li>
</ul>

			</li>
<li class="li">
				<p class="p">View extensions (added content in extension points)</p>

				<ul class="ul" id="loioaef3384510724522a07df94ec90d1351__ul_cbp_wyl_pp"><li class="li">
						<p class="p">If the extension point is removed or renamed or in an area or container
							which is invisible under certain conditions, the view extension will no
							longer be applied.</p>

					</li>
<li class="li">
						<p class="p">If the view name is changed or the extension point is moved to a
							different view, the view extension will no longer be applied.</p>

					</li>
<li class="li">
						<p class="p">If the controls around the extension point have changed or the extension
							point has been moved to a different environment inside the same view,
							view extensions may look weird, have a broken layout or display or do
							not really fit the new environment.</p>

					</li>
<li class="li">
						<p class="p">If the updated application requires the extension to be of a certain
							control type, the view extension may break the application.</p>

					</li>
<li class="li">
						<p class="p">If custom code relies on the presence of the extensions.</p>

					</li>
</ul>

			</li>
<li class="li">
				<p class="p">View replacements</p>

				<ul class="ul" id="loioaef3384510724522a07df94ec90d1351__ul_t4t_zyl_pp"><li class="li">
						<p class="p">If the original view name is changed or the view is no longer used, view replacements will
							no longer be applied.</p>

					</li>
<li class="li">
						<p class="p">As long as no other custom code relies on the view to be present, view replacements should
							not cause a crash.</p>

					</li>
</ul>

			</li>
<li class="li">
				<p class="p">Controller extensions</p>

				<ul class="ul" id="loioaef3384510724522a07df94ec90d1351__ul_x3b_jzl_pp"><li class="li">
						<p class="p">If the extension code accesses parts of the original application which are changed, for
							example, removed, have a different type or a different ID, controller
							extensions can cause a crash.</p>

					</li>
<li class="li">
						<p class="p">If the extension code makes assumptions about the application which are no longer valid
							after an update, controller extensions can lead to a crash.</p>

					</li>
<li class="li">
						<p class="p"> If original code is overwritten which is required for the application to run properly,
							controller extensions can lead to a crash.</p>

					</li>
<li class="li">
						<p class="p">If the controller name is changed, controller extensions are no longer applied.</p>

					</li>
</ul>

			</li>
<li class="li">
				<p class="p">Other extension types have similar caveats.</p>

			</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">In addition to this, all content changes such as additions, removals, and structure changes may
			affect CSS and JavaScript code which relies of the position of certain elements in the
			DOM. Partly these caveats are compatibility requirements for applications, partly they
			are suggestions for customizing development how to create more robust extensions.</p>
