<h1 class="title topictitle1">Defining Column Width</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc"/>
<p class="p">As API of the <samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.Column</samp> implies <samp class="ph codeph">width</samp> can be any
			valid CSS size(e.g 100px, 6em, 25%). Default value of the width is empty and this makes
			the column flexible which means it covers the remaining space. There are three important
			things that you should to define the width of the column properly.</p>
<ul class="ul" id="loio6f778a805bc3453dbb66e246d8271839__ol_q2b_rtj_ln"><li class="li">While defining the column width you can use percent values but you should be careful
				with percent values. Because, maybe this value fits to desktop screen well, but
				maybe not to mobile devices. In this case using absolute width(e.g. 200px, 4rem) can
				be better.</li>
<li class="li">Leave the most important column's width empty if your table demand pop-in. Let's say
				you have 100% width table with four columns each has 200px width and viewport is
				800px wide. Everything is fine. We resized the viewport to 500px. We can still show
				two columns nicely with setting the rest two columns to go pop-in. But after two
				columns go to pop-in total width of two main columns is 400px but the viewport is
				500px and table is 100%! In that case browser decides how to handle this. Current
				Chrome version increases the last column width and IE increases the first column
				width. But if we have Selection or Navigation these are also columns and browser can
				change the width of these column and that can look strange. So the best solution is
				leaving the most important column's width empty that it can take the much space as
				it can. In our example it will be 300px and all will be fine.</li>
<li class="li">Do not try to give percent width to all columns even if it reaches 100% total column
				width. What, if there is a <samp class="ph codeph">Selection(3rem width)</samp>,
					<samp class="ph codeph">Navigation(3rem width)</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">Deletion(3rem
				width)</samp>? In this case, the total width would be 100% + 6rem. Or if the total
				width is less than 100%, for example one column with 20% and the other column with
				40%, the total width would be 60% + 6rem. By default, <samp class="ph codeph">Table</samp> itself
				is in fixed layout mode and 100% width. The browser needs to decide how to share the
				width as it cannot fit to 100% width. In some cases browsers are smart and handle
				this correctly or it just looks correctly, but you should try to avoid such a use to
				get a cross browser result. As in 2nd point hit leaving the most important column
				width would fix this problem because then column will be flexible and cover the
				space. </li>
