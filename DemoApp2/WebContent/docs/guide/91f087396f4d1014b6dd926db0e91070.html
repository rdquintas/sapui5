<p class="p">SAPUI5 is a so-called <dfn class="term">Release Independent Component</dfn> (RIC). An important constraint
			for this is that it must be as simple as possible to upgrade to a newer version. This
			makes compatibility rules so important. </p>
<p class="p">The following sections explain the meaning of compatibility with regard to the SAPUI5 application
			and control development.</p>
<div class="section" id="loio91f087396f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070__section_DC50B59D56AC4B52A2DBEFADFA4B0E98"><div class="section_title">Versioning Scheme</div><div type="Versioning Scheme"> 
		 
		<p class="p">SAPUI5 uses a 3 digit version identifier, for
		  example 1.4.3. The digits have the following meaning: 
		</p>
 
		<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The first digit (1) specifies the <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">major</span> version number. </li>
<li class="li">The second digit (4) specifies the <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">minor</span> version number. </li>
<li class="li">The third digit (3) specifies the <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">patch</span> version number. </li>
</ul>
 
		<p class="p">New releases of SAPUI5 are described by the major and minor version number. The patch version
				number is only used to identify patches within a release.</p>

			<p class="p">If not mentioned differently, in the following paragraphs "API" refers to "public API",
				meaning functions, classes, namespaces, controls with their declared properties,
				aggregrations, and so on. The sole definition of the public API is the API
				Reference, which is available in the Demo Kit at  <a class="xref" href="../../docs/api/symbols/sap.ui.html">API Reference</a>. Features
				that are <strong class="ph b">not</strong> mentioned there are <strong class="ph b">not</strong> part of the API.</p>

			<p class="p">The following rules apply for introducing new APIs or making incompatible changes to
				existing APIs: </p>

			<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">major release</strong>, that is, a release with a new major version can introduce new
				APIs or make incompatible changes to existing APIs. If this is the case, the
				incompatibilities are described in the Release Notes. </p>

			<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">minor release</strong>, that is, a release with a new minor version can introduce new
				APIs, but does not contain incompatible changes to APIs, which have been introduced
				in the same major release. </p>

			<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">patch release</strong>, that is, a release with a new patch version, only contain fixes to the
				existing implementation, but do not introduce new features or incompatible API
				changes.</p>

			<p class="p">If possible, SAPUI5 marks old artifacts as deprecated and creates new artifacts, if

				artifact has been deprecated and provide hints how to achieve the same results
				without deprecated functionality.</p>

				changes to their API are very likely; in these cases, even incompatible changes in
				minor releases may occur. They are included in public releases to collect feedback
				from early adopters. Consumers of such APIs must understand that their respective
				code might be broken (repeatedly) when upgrading to new SAPUI5 releases and they
				must be willing to adapt to such changes.</p>
