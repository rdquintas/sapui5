<p class="p">Some features or controls delivered with this SAPUI5 version are flagged as “experimental”.
			These experimental features and controls are not part of the released scope of the
			delivered SAPUI5 version. Experimental features or controls can be changed, or deleted,
			at any time without notice and without a formal deprecation process. Also, these
			features may be incompatible to changes in interfaces and functions provided in an
			upgrade and, thus, break sample applications using the experimental features or
			controls.</p>
<p class="p">The purpose of including experimental features and controls in a public release is to
			collect feedback from partners and customers at an early stage, thus allowing the
			partners and customers to influence the future product with their feedback. Experimental
			features are not intended for productive use: You must not demonstrate, test, examine,
			evaluate or otherwise use experimental features or controls in a productive environment,
			or with data that has not been sufficiently backed up.</p>
<p class="p">To provide feedback, use the SCN Developer Center on <a class="extlink" href="http://help.sap.com/disclaimer?site=http://scn.sap.com/community/developer-center/front-end">http://scn.sap.com/community/developer-center/front-end<img src="images/sap_link.png" class="link-sap" alt="Information published on SAP site" title="Information published on SAP site" border="0"/></a>. By providing your feedback, you accept that Intellectual
