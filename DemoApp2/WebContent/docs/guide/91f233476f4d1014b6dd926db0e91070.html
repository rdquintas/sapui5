<p class="p">In the Model View Controller concept, the representation of information is separated from the
			user's interaction: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The <dfn class="term">view</dfn> is responsible for defining and rendering the UI. </li>
<li class="li">The <dfn class="term">model</dfn> manages the application data. </li>
<li class="li">The <dfn class="term">controller</dfn> reacts to view events and user interaction by modifying the view and
				model. </li>
</ul>
<img class="image" id="loio91f233476f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070__image_gz3_xdw_vk" src="loio1eb216151b1b41f1979b7b6c969670df_LowRes.png" alt="SAPUI5 Model View Controller Concept" title="SAPUI5 Model View Controller Concept"/><p class="p">The purpose of data binding in the UI is to separate the definition of the user interface
				(<dfn class="term">view</dfn>), the data  visualized by the application (<dfn class="term">model</dfn>),
			and the code for the business logic for processing the data (<dfn class="term">controller</dfn>).
			The separation has the following advantages: It provides  better readability,
			maintainability, and extensibility and it allows you to change the view without touching
			the underlying business logic and to define several views of the same data. </p>
<p class="p">With this pattern, a separation is achieved that facilitates development and change of parts
			independently. </p>
<p class="p">Views and controllers often form a 1:1 relationship, but it is also possible to have controllers
			without a UI, these controllers are called application controllers. It is also possible
			to create views without controllers. From a technical position, a view is a SAPUI5
			control and can have or inherit a SAPUI5 model. </p>
<p class="p">View and controller represent reusable units, and distributed development is highly
			supported.</p>
