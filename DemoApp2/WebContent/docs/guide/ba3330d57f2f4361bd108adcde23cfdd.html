<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The <span class="ph pname">Configure KPI Drill-Down</span> app allows you to configure the generic
		drill-down application that you navigate to when you click the KPI or OPI tile in the
		runtime environment. </p>
<div class="p">There are several different kinds of chart available and you can configure aspects such
			as the color, how the data is sorted, and whether data from associated KPIs should be
			displayed. <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> You do not need to activate a drill-down configuration. Each time you

<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Configure the Facet Filter</div><div type="Configure the Facet Filter">
			
			<p class="p">The facet filter allows the SAP Smart Business user to filter the information shown on the
				screen at runtime. The user can filter based on any of the dimensions present in the
				entity set of the virtual data model (VDM) in the backend. At runtime, the user can
				also either choose to have all values of a specific dimension or restrict the data
				set to specified values of the dimension.</p>

			<p class="p">A change in filter values triggers a refresh of the KPI aggregate value, the mini
				charts, and the view currently being displayed. The data is displayed with the
				filter values applied. Mini charts for which the filter dimensions are not suitable
				are not displayed.</p>

			<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> Depending on the number of mini charts displayed, performance issues may arise due
				to the additional backend calls that are required to refresh each tile whenever
				filter values are changed.</div>

			<p class="p">Using the <span class="ph pname">Configure KPI Drill-Down</span> app, at design time you can choose the
				default dimensions that appear in the facet filter bar at runtime; however you
				cannot pre-select default values for each of the dimensions.</p>

			<div class="p">At runtime, the SAP Smart Business user can carry out the following adjustments to
				the facet filter:<ul class="ul" id="loioba3330d57f2f4361bd108adcde23cfdd__ul_dbr_rv4_n4"><li class="li">Toggle the visibility of the facet filter bar.</li>
<li class="li">Reset the applied filter values to <span class="ph uicontrol">All</span> for all of the dimensions
						currently added to the filter bar.</li>
<li class="li">Add any of the remaining dimensions present in the VDM to the facet filter bar, or hide
						dimensions that are currently visible.</li>
</ul>
</div>

			<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
				<ol class="ol" id="loioba3330d57f2f4361bd108adcde23cfdd__ol_m45_wv4_n4"><li class="li">The values listed for each dimension of the facet filter are only retrieved
						from the backend when you click the dimension.</li>
<li class="li">When multiple filters are applied, each of the filters is not applied
						separately but together with the other specified filters. That is, the
						system filters on the following basis: <ol class="ol" type="a" id="loioba3330d57f2f4361bd108adcde23cfdd__ol_v24_1w4_n4"><li class="li">Filter1 = Value1 and Filter 2 = Value 2 <p class="p">and not</p>
</li>
<li class="li">Filter1 = Value 1 or Filter 2 = Value 2<p class="p">Also, every time a filter value is specified,
									the filter values for the rest of the dimensions are refreshed
									based on the currently selected filter values as in the
									following example:</p>

								<p class="p">You have selected 3 dimensions for the filter bar: Filter 1 (all
									countries where a company has manufacturing plants), Filter 2
									(all cities where a company has manufacturing plants), and
									Filter 3 (all heads of the manufacturing plants).</p>
<p class="p">At
									runtime, if the user clicks a country in Filter 1, only the
									cities within that country are used to populate the value list
									for Filter 2 and only the manufacturing plants within that
									country are used to populate the value list for Filter 3. The
									values within Filter 2 and Filter 3 are only updated when the
									user clicks the respective filters.</p>
<p class="p">If nothing is selected
									in any of the filters and the user chooses a city in Filter 2,
									the values of Filter 1 and Filter 3 are filtered based on the
									selected city. If the user now selects a user in Filter 3, then
									the values within Filter 1 and Filter 2 are again refreshed
									based on the Filter 3 selection. That is, only countries that
									represent the chosen cities (Filter 2) and countries that have
									manufacturing plants headed by the chosen individual (Filter 3)
									are displayed in the Filter 1 value list.</p>

<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Show or Hide the KPI Aggregate Value</div><div type="Show or Hide the KPI Aggregate Value">
			
			<p class="p">You can choose to either to show or hide the KPI aggregate value at runtime. If you choose to
				show the KPI aggregate value, this value refreshes each time the facet filter value
				is refreshed. The unit of measure (UoM) of the KPI’s main measure is also shown,
				together with the KPI aggregate value, if it is maintained in the VDM and also
				present in the OData service as an SAP annotation.</p>

		</div></div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Display KPI Visualizations in the KPI Header</div><div type="Display KPI Visualizations in the KPI Header">
			
			<p class="p">You can add tile visualizations (mini charts) to the drill-down. The following types of mini
				chart are supported: number, bullet, trend, comparison, and comparison multiple
				measures. Any or all of these visualizations can be added to the header for all
				evaluations related to the current evaluation for which the drill-down is
				configured. This includes the current KPI’s other evaluations, as well as all
				evaluations of the KPIs associated with the current KPI.</p>

			<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> When you add mini charts to the drill-down, the additional load on the system
				affects performance.</div>

			<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> If the SAP Smart Business user applies a value filter for any of the dimensions,
				the values in the mini chart are updated based on the filter. If it is not possible
				to apply the filter, the mini chart is overlayed by a gray area to indicate that it
				might be outdated.</div>

		</div></div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Copy Drill-Down Configurations to other Evaluations</div><div type="Copy Drill-Down Configurations to other Evaluations">
			
			<div class="p">You can copy drill-down configurations configured for one evaluation and paste them to another
				evaluation. All the filter configurations, KPI mini charts, and views are copied if
				they are applicable. The conditions that determine whether it is possible to apply
				the copy-paste are as follows:<ul class="ul" id="loioba3330d57f2f4361bd108adcde23cfdd__ul_t41_1gf_dp"><li class="li">The copy is applicable only if the measures and dimensions that make up the
						filters or views are also present in the entity set used for the target
						evaluation.</li>
<li class="li">The mini charts are copied only if the source and target evaluation are from
						the same KPI (in this case, only the mini charts of the parent KPI are
						copied, the mini charts of the associated KPIs are ignored).</li>
</ul>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> When you click <span class="ph uicontrol">Copy</span>, paste is only enabled if the
					evaluation is compatible with copy-paste based on these conditions.</div>
</div>

			<p class="p">A drill-down configuration can consist of many views in either the chart or table format. You
				can reorganize the views and edit or delete them as required. You can make the
				following configurations for each view:</p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loioba3330d57f2f4361bd108adcde23cfdd__ul_wwl_cjd_44"><li class="li">Measures and Dimensions<p class="p">You can choose which measures and dimensions to add to the chart
						or table representation. All measures and dimensions configured in the
						entity set of the VDM in the backend are available for selection.</p>
<p class="p">To
						make the following additional configurations for each measure or dimension,
						click the Gear icon beside the individual dimension or measure.</p>
</li>
</ul>

			<ul class="ul" id="loioba3330d57f2f4361bd108adcde23cfdd__ul_ozz_jkp_n4"><li class="li">Sort Order<p class="p">Choose either ascending, descending, or no sorting order. You can
						also choose on which measure or dimension the sorting is carried out when a
						sort is selected for this measure or dimension. The sorting is done on the
						order of the listing of the measure or dimension. For example, Measure 1 is
						sorted in ascending order and Measure 2 in descending order. If Measure 1 is
						listed above Measure 2 at design time, then at runtime the data is first
						sorted on Measure 1 (ascending order) and then on Measure 2 (in descending
						order).</p>
<p class="p">In <span class="ph uicontrol">Dummy Data</span> mode, sorting is not
						possible. You must use <span class="ph uicontrol">Runtime Mode</span> for the data
						source to check the sorting behavior at design time. At runtime, you can
						also change the sort order by clicking the header of the column.</p>
</li>
</ul>

			<ul class="ul" id="loioba3330d57f2f4361bd108adcde23cfdd__ul_dnp_glp_n4"><li class="li">Hide in Table<p class="p">You can hide the measure or dimension in the table view.</p>

				</li>
<li class="li">Enable Stacking<p class="p">You can choose whether measures or dimensions are stacked in
						the chart visualization. Stacking is only possible for bar charts and column
						charts. For all other visualizations, you cannot change the default
						behavior. When stacking is enabled, you can either choose to stack all
						chosen measures or choose a single stacking dimension. Stacking on both
						measure and dimension is not possible. When dual axis charts are selected,
						stacking is always done on measures only, dimension stacking is not
						possible.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">Visualization Type<div class="p">You can choose from the following visualization types:<ul class="ul" id="loioba3330d57f2f4361bd108adcde23cfdd__ul_wpq_yjd_44"><li class="li">Bar Chart</li>
<li class="li">Column Chart</li>
<li class="li">Line Chart</li>
<li class="li">Combination Chart (Columns and Lines)</li>
<li class="li">Bubble Chart</li>
<li class="li">Table</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="p">If you configure a chart visualization, then at runtime the SAP
						Smart Business user can toggle to a table view. However if you configure a
						table visualization, there is no option to toggle to a chart view at
						runtime.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">Configure a Single or a Dual Axis<p class="p">This is applicable only to bar or column
						charts. If you configure a dual axis then you must also select the measure
						against which each axis should be created. In a dual axis chart, only two
						bars or columns are present, therefore all measures must either be part of
						the first bar or column (Stack 1) or second bar or column (Stack 2). As part
						of dual axis configuration, at runtime you can specify which measures should
						make up the Stack 1 – all other measures are then added to Stack 2.
						Dimension stacking is not possible in a dual axis chart.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">Configure Absolute or Percentage Values<p class="p">Absolute charts display the exact value in the
						graph. Percentage graphs display the scale of the axis from 0 to 100 (based
						on possible percentage values) and all measures are stacked. Dimension
						staking is not possible here. In a percentage chart, the value inside the
						bar or column represents the absolute value. Only the axis values are in a
						percentage basis and the text beside the axis lists the names of all
						measures with <span class="ph uicontrol">in %</span> appended to them.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">Configure the Color Scheme<p class="p">SAP Smart Business allows the following color
						schemes:</p>

<div class="tablenoborder"><table summary="" id="loioba3330d57f2f4361bd108adcde23cfdd__table_efp_nnp_n4" class="table" frame="border" border="1" rules="all"><tbody class="tbody"><tr class="row"><td class="entry" valign="top" width="50%">Default colors</td>

										color scheme. The colors are applied directly by the SAP
										Fiori framework.</td>

<tr class="row"><td class="entry" valign="top" width="50%">Manual non-semantic color</td>
<td class="entry" valign="top" width="50%">You can choose the color for each measure from the SAP

</tr>
<tr class="row"><td class="entry" valign="top" width="50%">Manual semantic color </td>
<td class="entry" valign="top" width="50%">You can choose the color for each measure from the SAP Fiori semantic color palette.
										The semantic color palette is used where the color has a
										symbolic meaning (for example, green for OK, yellow for
										warning, and red for critical). You configure the color by
										clicking the Gear icon beside the individual measure. For
										example, you want to display a plant’s cost and profit
										measurements for each financial year. It is visually clearer
										to always color the cost with the bad semantic color (red)
										and profit with good semantic color (green) rather than with
										other colors. In such a case, you choose the
											<span class="ph uicontrol">Manual semantic color</span> scheme to
										assign the bad semantic color to cost and good semantic
										color to profit.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row"><td class="entry" valign="top" width="50%">Auto semantic color</td>
<td class="entry" valign="top" width="50%">You must mark one measure as the threshold measure. At

</li>
<li class="li">Set the Data Limit<p class="p">By default, the <span class="ph uicontrol">Set Data Limit</span> checkbox is
						unchecked. Checking this opens a textbox where you can enter a valid integer
						representing the number of records to be retrieved. By default this value is
						set to 200. Changing this number is only necessary if the data source is set
						to <span class="ph uicontrol">Runtime Mode</span> (see <span class="ph uicontrol">Data</span> in
						this document). If you do not set the data limit at design time, at runtime
						the system retrieves all data in the backend (if you set the data limit,
						this is the maximum number of records that the system retrieves).</p>
</li>
<li class="li">Data<p class="p">This setting is only for the preview mode of the visualization at design time. At
						runtime, SAP Smart Business always retrieves the real-time data from the
						backend. By default the data shown in the design time chart configuration is
						dummy data. If required, you can select <span class="ph uicontrol">Runtime Mode</span>
						to use the real-time data. This setting is not saved, therefore each time
						you visit this screen the data source always points to dummy data.</p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loioba3330d57f2f4361bd108adcde23cfdd__ul_hdj_1qp_n4"><li class="li">Add to Home<p class="p">When the SAP Smart Business user navigates to the generic drill-down from the
						KPI or OPI tile, the <span class="ph uicontrol">Save as Tile</span> option is available
						in the footer. This creates a new tile both in the catalog as well as the
						user’s home page in the <span class="ph uicontrol">My Home</span> group. All the
						filters applied in the drill-down are also applied to the tile, which is
						visible only to the user who has created it.</p>
<p class="p">When creating the
						personalized tile, the user must specify a subtitle. They can also change
						the threshold values if the existing threshold for the current evaluation is
						not dynamic (that is, the threshold type is not a measure but has fixed
						value). </p>
<p class="p">If the evaluation for which the drill-down is configured has
						a percentage-based (%) main measure, wherever the main measure or threshold
						measures are used in the drill-down configuration (defined for this
						evaluation using the <span class="ph pname">Create Evaluation</span> modeler app), the
						value returned from the VDM in the backend is assumed to be percentage-based
						and is displayed as a percentage. For example, if the backend returns a
						value 0.70 it is displayed as 70%.</p>
<p class="p">Additionally, all measures are
						assumed to be percentage-based if they are used together with the main
						measure or threshold measures when the evaluation has percentage-based
						scaling. However, this does not apply to dual axis charts or views that have
						only table display. For views with table display only, percentage-based
						measures are displayed as a percentage, whereas non percentage-based
						measures are not. For dual axis charts, the measures for each axis are
						checked. The axis is displayed as a percentage if at least one value among
						the measures is percentage-based.</p>
<p class="p">If the user clicks the mini chart of
						an associated KPI’s evaluation, it is possible to navigate to the drill-down
						configuration of that evaluation. If no drill-down is configured, an
						information message is displayed.</p>

					evaluation’s main measure is displayed in the view, the name of the measure is
					not shown in the axis. At runtime, users can export all data in excel format.
					The data set used for the export is the complete data set in the backend but
					takes into consideration any specified data limit. The sort order, if specified,
					is also preserved. Data in any hidden columns (in the table view) is also
